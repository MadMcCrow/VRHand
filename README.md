# VRHand
A simple plugin to help with Hand motion in VR.

# What it does 
it bypasses the UE4 traditionnal way of dealing with inputs by simply getting the different motion controllers buttons and inputs maps to finger data. allowing you to both use action inputs and directly feed those finger data to your Motion Controllers Actors.

# UE4 Version
Tested with UE 4.25

# HMD Compatibility :
Only tested with HTC Vive, but should be compatible with the Headset already compatible with UE4.
You can easily extend and modify this plugin to better fit your setup.
